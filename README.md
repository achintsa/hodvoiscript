Pitch: Voice to text with feature extraction and sentiment analysis

Record voice and convert to text transcript. This has multiple use cases. Especially for people who cannot hear, they can "read" transcripts of what is spoken. If someone arrives in middle of meeting, then he/ she can know the context of the conversation/ meeting. Later, "minutes of meeting" can be generated.
This can further be extended using sentiment analysis to gather knowledge regarding sentiments (positive/ negative terms) and corresponding score. More text analytics can be further applied.
(this includes future plans too)
